🧩 Why MindGym?

Traditional wellness apps focus on meditation or journaling.
Brain-training apps focus only on cognitive skills.
MindGym uniquely blends both—building a stronger mind through:

✔ Quick daily workouts
✔ Emotional self-awareness
✔ AI-backed improvement loops
✔ A gamified experience that keeps users engaged

This combination gives MindGym a holistic, proactive mental fitness identity.
